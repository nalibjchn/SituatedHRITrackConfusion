ABSTRACT={Successful conversational interaction with a social robot requires not only an assessment of a user’s contribution to an interaction, but also awareness of their emotional and attitudinal states as the interaction unfolds. To this end, our research aims to systematically trigger, but then interpret human behaviors to track different states of potential user confusion in interaction so that systems can be primed to adjust their policies in light of users entering confusion states. In this paper, we present a detailed human-robot interaction study to prompt, investigate, and eventually detect confusion states in users. The study itself employs a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) style design with a Pepper robot to prompt confusion states for task-oriented dialogues in a well-defined manner. The data collected from 81 participants includes audio and visual data, from both the robot’s perspective and the environment, as well as participant survey data. From these data, we evaluated the correlations of induced confusion conditions with multimodal data, including eye gaze estimation, head pose estimation, facial emotion detection, silence duration time, and user speech analysis—including emotion and pitch analysis. Analysis shows significant differences of participants’ behaviors in states of confusion based on these signals, as well as a strong correlation between confusion conditions and participants own self-reported confusion scores. The paper establishes strong correlations between confusion levels and these observable features, and lays the ground or a more complete social and affect oriented strategy for task-oriented human-robot interaction. The contributions of this paper include the methodology applied, dataset, and our systematic analysis.}
